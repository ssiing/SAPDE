# SAPDE
We made some changes to the work of byungjae89 and added the evaluation indicators of pro and ap, but unfortunately, pro is applicable to other network frameworks but does not include this code, the pro we get is extremely low, making this indicator no reference
The specific address of the reference: https://github.com/byungjae89/SPADE-pytorch#sub-image-anomaly-detection-with-deep-pyramid-correspondences-spade-in-pytorch
