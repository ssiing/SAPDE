# SAPDE
We made some changes to the work of byungjae89 and added the evaluation indicators of pro and ap, but unfortunately, pro is applicable to other network frameworks but does not include this code, the pro we get is extremely low, making this indicator no reference.
It requires the same work as byungjae89, the only difference is that you need to download the mvtec dataset and unzip it, put it in the mvtec_anomaly_detection folder under the data folder, and then run main.py. I provided the data results I got after training in the test_log.txt file. you can use as reference.
